The repo contains two apps. The client and the server.

### Client

2. go into the client folder - `cd client`
3. run - `yarn install`
   - if you don't have yarn, find instructions to install yarn
4. run - `yarn start`

### Server

1. open a new terminal instance for Reflecta
2. go into the server folder - `cd server`

Once both client and server are running, the app should be ready to test or work on.
